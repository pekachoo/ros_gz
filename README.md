# AP Research Simulation Code Base

This repository contains the code base used for my AP Research simulation using Gazebo and ROS. The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate the functionalities and applications of robotic simulations in a research context.

## Overview

This project includes:
- URDF files for modeling robots.
- Launch files for running simulations in Gazebo and visualizing in RViz.
- Configuration files for differential drive and mecanum drive robots.

Code base was found here: https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz
